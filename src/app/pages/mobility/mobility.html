"I went to Barcelona, Spain, in 2019 as part of a linguistic mobility program as it allowed me to improve significantly my Spanish.

It was an amazing opportunity to immerse myself in the local culture and experience the differences in mindset compared to France, especially since I was living with a host familywho spoke only Spanish.

  title="International Mobility in Netherlands"
  text=
"In 2023, I had the opportunity to go to the Netherlands to attend a LAN event in 's-Hertogenbosch and also spent a day in Amsterdam. It was an incredible experience to discover a new culture and meet people not only from the Netherlands but from all over Europe and even overseas.

Dutch culture was quite eye-opening, as their approach to personal freedom is very different from France’s, particularly regarding choices about their own bodies and lifestyle, as well as attitudes toward drugs. I was especially impressed by how extensively bicycles are used for daily commuting, and it gave me hope that more countries will develop infrastructure to support cycling as they have in the Netherlands.

I was there during Pride Week, which gave me a firsthand look at how open-minded and accepting people are. The celebrationof diversity and inclusion made a strong impression on me.

The Dutch people were very friendly and welcoming, and it was fascinating to observe how life differs there compared to France.

The experience also helped me significantly improve my English, as it is widely spoken in the Netherlands and the locals are very proficient in it.

  title="International Mobility Project, in Brussels, Belgium"
  text=
"I am planning to go to Brussels, Belgium, in 2026 as part of an international mobility project, attending courses at ULB, one of the top universities in Brussels and Belgium. All the courses will be in English, which will help me improve my language skills. This project is motivated by several factors:

I am considering possibly moving to Belgium in the future to work or find an internship during my third year, and this experience will allow me to explore the country’s culture, which is shaped by a unique mix of traditions and ways of life. It will also be a great opportunity to network with students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives.
  
As Belgium is the capital of Europe, I will be able to observe how people coexist with two official languages, French and Dutch, while also meeting individuals from many other countries.

Studying abroad will help me develop independence and adaptability skills that are increasingly valuable in today’s globalized world.

Additionally, I will be able to experience the cultural and mindset differences compared to France, especially within Brussels’ francophone community.

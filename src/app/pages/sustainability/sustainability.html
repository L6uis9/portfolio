  "During this program, my team and I had the opportunity to mentor 7th-grade students from underprivileged areas, guiding them as they learned about robotics with the goal of participating in a competition at La Cité de l’Espace. It was a chance for them to discover the engineering profession and to realize that it is an achievable path for them.

  We organized several activities to help them understand how to give instructions to a robot and how to translate those instructions into code, from guiding a blindfolded teammate to a specific point, to then reproducing those commands on the robot.

  We also arranged visits to research laboratories such as LAAS and to engineering schools like ENSAT, so they could explore the engineering world more broadly.

  This experience brought me a lot of joy as I watched the students grow more confident week after week. I also learned a lot about mentoring and patience.

  At ENSEEIHT, I took part in several engagement and sustainability initiatives that broadened my awareness of social and environmental challenges, while also serving as a student delegate in 2nd Year.

  I first participated in the Climate Fresk, where our group collaborated and debated the scientific causes and consequences of climate change, an exercise that highlighted the importance of collective understanding and action.

  I also engaged in the 2tonnes workshop, which helped me grasp the concrete efforts, trade-offs, and lifestyle changes required to reach a carbon footprint of 2 tonnes per person, which is the maximum level we should aim for to protect the planet.

  Additionally, I joined a Disability Awareness Day, during which my group worked with an Indian exchange student to design an inclusive project. We proposed “Magic Gloves,” a concept aimed at improving communication for Deaf individuals with people who do not know sign language.

  I also took part in the Diversity Fresk, an experience that allowed our group to explore issues related to bias, discrimination, and inclusion, and to reflect on how to foster more equitable environments.

  Finally, I participated in an Entrepreneurship Day, where my team designed the idea of an app called RaclEasy, a cooperative app designed to connect people who want to share a raclette meal, helping reduce social isolation by bringing individuals together around everyday moments.
